# Enrichment and depletion analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook contains a comprehensive analysis focusing on gene expression, co-expression, and variability in transcriptional regulation. The primary context of the study involves the investigation of transcriptional regulation in different tissues and during various developmental stages.

## Data Sources
- Gene expression data from various tissues and developmental stages.
- WormBase: A database containing detailed information about gene annotation for the studied organism.

## Key Libraries Used
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- `scipy`: For scientific and technical computing.
- `statsmodels`: For estimating statistical models, conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration.

## Main Components of the Notebook

### Data Preparation
- Loading gene expression datasets from different tissues and developmental stages.
- Reading and processing gene annotations from WormBase.

### Gene Mapping Functions
- Functions to map WormBase IDs to gene names and vice versa, facilitating ease of analysis.

### Data Analysis
- Calculation of variability scores (Variation Score and Coefficient of Variation) for genes across different conditions.
- Identification of genes with specific patterns of expression variability.

### Development and Tissue Binning
- Classification of genes based on their expression variability into different bins (e.g., highly variant, moderately variant, invariant).

### Statistical Analysis
- Performing hypergeometric tests to understand the enrichment of genes in different variability bins.
- Correlation analysis between variability scores in development and tissues.

### Quadrant Analysis
- Categorization of genes into quadrants based on their variability scores in both development and tissue datasets.

### Enrichment Analysis
- Pathway and phenotype enrichment analysis for genes in different quadrants and bins.
- Specific focus on lipid metabolism and stress response-related genes.

### Data Visualization
- Extensive use of bar plots and heatmaps for visualizing the distribution of genes across various categories and their associated scores.

## Conclusions
The notebook provides a detailed methodology for analyzing gene expression variability and its implications in different biological contexts. The results offer insights into the transcriptional regulation landscape, highlighting key genes and pathways that exhibit distinct variability patterns. 

## Usage
- For researchers studying gene expression variability and regulation.
- As a template for similar analyses in other organisms or contexts.

## Requirements
- Ensure all the required libraries are installed.
- Necessary data files should be correctly placed in the specified directories.
