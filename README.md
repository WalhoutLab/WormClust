# <b>Systems-level transcriptional regulation of metabolism in *C.elegans*
  ## **Introduction**

We developed a computational pipeline to unravel transcriptional regulation of metabolism in *C.elegans* at a systems-level. It is written mainly in Python, with parts written in MATLAB and shell script. It has been developed for a development dataset, tissue dataset and a compendium of 177 expression datasets. However, this pipeline is applicable to any expression dataset- whether RNA-Seq or microarray. It consists of following major parts:
  
  ### 1) Finding extent of transcriptional regulation of metabolism
    a) During Development- Using Variation Score (VS)
    b) Across tissues- Using Coefficient of Variation (CV)
    c) Across compendium of expression datasets - Using CV 
    
  ### 2) Finding prevalence of transcriptional regulation at pathway level
    a) Supervised approach
    b) Unsupervised approach
