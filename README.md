# <b>Systems-level transcriptional regulation of metabolism in *C.elegans*
  ## ** Introduction**

We developed a computational pipeline to unravel transcriptional regulation of metabolism in *C.elegans* at a systems-level. It is written mainly in Python, with parts written in MATLAB and shell script. It has been developed for a development dataset, tissue dataset and a compendium of 177 expression datasets. However, this pipeline is applicable to any expression dataset- whether RNA-Seq or microarray. It consists of following major parts:
